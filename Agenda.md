Our workshop activities are flexible in size. They can accommodate 16 to 50 participants depending on the size of the space and the number of in-person and remote participants. The workshop will employ 8 to 12-person working groups. The minimum number of working groups we need is two. We will create additional working groups if the number of participants exceeds 24. The organizers will attend the workshops, and we will always have at least one of the organizers playing the role of facilitator for each working group.

**Session 1: Lightning Talks.**
Session 1 will have a brief welcome. This will immediately be followed by lightning presentations. Each participant will be given a few minutes to present the gist of their position paper and detail why they have an interest in this workshop. The amount of time allocated for each presentation will be adjusted based on the number of participants who register. If the workshop is larger than 24, then we will run two parallel sessions. Presentations will be organized based on the themes drawn out of the submitted position papers.

The lightning talks will provide participants to get to know a little bit about one another. This should build a little trust among participants, making later workshop activities more effective. In addition, it will provide a first view of everyoneâ€™s interests that will be important during the final session.

**Coffee Break**

**Session 2: Brainstorming Round 1.**
For session 2, we will break participants into working groups based both on thematic fit of position papers and on their interest with working on HCI education priorities or on HCI research priorities. A member of the organizing committee will facilitate a brainstorming session to draw out and discuss different priorities. The collected set of ideas will be ranked in terms of their priority to the participants. In addition, they will be classified as long-term or short-term, and they will detail dependencies among the different idea.

The working groups will reform into a larger group. Each will share the priorities they identified and their rationale for rankings and classifications. We will have a short discussion to see if there is collective agreement and to discover new perspectives on the situation.

**Lunch**

**Session 3: Brainstorming Round 2.**
For session 3, we will form new working groups, allowing participants to self-select the theme and topic (education priorities or research priorities) they want to work on. We will engage in a second round of brainstorming facilitated by workshop organizers. Synthesis of the ideas will deviate from the first round in that we will push participants to provide more detailed rationales for the rankings and the classification. We expect this round will reproduce many of the ideas from round 1 as well as new ideas that come from some personal reflection and from the larger group discussion. Once again, the working groups will come back together and share and discuss their sets of priorities.


**Coffee Break**

**Session 4: Collaboration Speed Dating.**
During the coffee break, organizers will collect lists of matches between participants. These are explicit indications of other participants a participant wishes to talk to about future collaboration. Based on their indications, we will generate a short list of one-on-one collaboration meetings. 

During the speed dating session, participants will have 8 minutes to sit together and talk about future collaboration. At the end of the eight minutes, they will rotate to the next name on their speed dating list. Our hope for this activity is that at the end of the workshop we will have facilitated the genesis of several new collaborations around the topic of policy and HCI.

**Session 5: Wrap-up.**
In the final few minutes of the workshop, we will hold a group discussion about writing a paper describing the workshop and the priorities that emerged. We will collectively discuss the best venue for the paper and collect names of everyone who wishes to participate in writing. We were particularly impressed with the impact of a paper on social computer that emerged from a workshop and had participation from almost all who attended \cite{kittur2013future}. We hope to have a similar impact from this post-workshop activity.
