Accounting for technologies' unintended consequences — whether they are misinformation on social media or issues of sustainability and social justice — increasingly requires HCI to consider technology design at a societal-level scale. At this scale, public and corporate policies play a critical role in shaping technologies and user behaviors. 
How can technology design and policies better inform and coordinate with each other in generating safe new technologies?
What new solutions might emerge when HCI practitioners design technology and its policies simultaneously to account for its societal impacts?
This one-day, hybrid workshop brings together HCI, design, and policy communities to explore these questions.

Submissions may address one or both questions in a position paper (1-2 pages) or a short research paper (4-6 pages).
Submissions may focus on broad insights into the opportunities and open questions around designing tech and policy simultaneously.
Submissions can also offer specific research or case studies.
We especially encourage submissions related to society-level-scale technologies and HCI concerns where design+policy can be particularly valuable.
Submissions should use the single-column ACM template. 

The submission link will be available here on the **workshop website** [yang-qian.github.io/designpolicyCHI23](http://yang-qian.github.io/designpolicyCHI23). We also plan to make the accepted workshop papers available on the website.
All submissions will be reviewed by the workshop’s co-organizers and other expert invited reviewers. Authors of the highest-rated submissions will be invited to give lightning talks (Session 1) with our invited speakers. At least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop. All participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the conference.
